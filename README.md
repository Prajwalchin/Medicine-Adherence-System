# Projects Overview

The Smart Pillbox System is a cutting-edge solution addressing medication non-adherence, a significant factor affecting patient health and healthcare costs. It enables doctors to input prescriptions via voice or by image of the prescription, ensuring accuracy through digital conversion and verification against a medication database. Once validated, the system generates a personalized medication schedule with timely notifications on both a mobile app and smartwatch, where vibrations serve as critical reminders.

The digital pillbox features a sensor to monitor medication presence and sends refill alerts when necessary. It tracks whether medications are taken as prescribed, sending automated reminders for missed doses and recording adherence in real-time. Insights from the wellness monitoring section of the smartwatch utilize AI to analyze health changes related to medication use.

To support patients further, adherence reports are accessible to healthcare providers for monitoring and intervention. Patients can maintain a medication diary within the app to log their experiences. The system also motivates adherence through rewards for consistent compliance, such as discounts on future doctor visits and creative notifications. Caregiver alerts ensure support in cases of missed doses.

Overall, the smart pillbox system not only aims to improve medication adherence but also creates a supportive ecosystem that empowers patients in managing their health effectively.
